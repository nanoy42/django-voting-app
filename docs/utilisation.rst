User guide
==========

Normal users have access to the list of votes. Eac vote appears in one of three colors :

* yellow : the vote is ready but has not begun
* green : the vote is ongoing
* red : the vote is finished

You will see all ready votes, even if you have the right to vote in (if you are not in the good group, or if you have already voted for instance).

For each vote, it will be indicated if you have already voted or not (in the top right corner).

If you have the right to vote (the vote is ready, ongoing, you meet the group requirements and you have not yet already voted), you will be presented a voting page.
You will have access to all the relevant documents and to every question of the vote. You must select a unique answer for each question and then validate your vote.
Once you have voted, you can't modify or delete your vote in any way.
