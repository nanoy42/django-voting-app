A note on deployment : django-voting-app uses semantic versioning to name its versions, meaning something like major.minor.fix.

The ``main`` branch holds the latest tagged version of django-voting-app and should always be considered as released.

While we try to maintain a no-bug policy in the ``dev`` branch, the code there should not be considered really for release and should only be used at your own risks,
